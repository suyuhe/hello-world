In many ways, this map is a love letter to Chinatown. I centre much of my place-based identity in Chinatowns given my family's immigration history of settling in Chinatown, Calgary. Its a place where I still do a lot of errands and I often take friends on a personal tour of the area while checking out local shops. This map is designed to translate this tour and my knowledge of Chinatown. 

Particularly, the tour and map highlight the layers of contested spaces through displacement, place-based histories and competing boundaries. The official Vancouver city boundaries are imposed as layers you can toggle. Notably, Chinatown is not an official place. Rather, Chinatown sits in the middle of the boundaries of downtown and strathcona neighbourhoods, highlighting competing spaces and boundaries. The city boundaries act as very sharp dividing areas - they cut through the middle of the tour path, and obscure from the underlying map colours and design. This highlights the tensions between official boundaries and stories, and personal stories. Furthermore, gentrification is highlighted as a contemporary form of displacement such as through the tour stop at 105 Keefer St and the contradictions within the Wing Sang Building. Throughout the tour, I highlight other layers of competing boundaries by exploring historical Japantown and Hogan's Alley, both unofficial ethnic enclaves that existed in the 1900s and were torn down due to systemic racism and classism. 

Given that this map is a translation of my personal knowledge, sense of place, and connection to Chinatown I wanted the map to convey my sense of fun, happiness and dream-like nostalgia (as connected to my personal family history) that I experience walking through Chinatown. Therefore, I chose more unconventional colours including the muted pastel purple to represent landcover and the bright pink to convey such qualities. I matched the other colours to create a pastel palette including muted greens and blues for parks and water cover. I got rid of most of the default labels for places such as restaurants, shops and schools to declutter the map and enable the viewer to focus on the tour spots highlighted. This palette was inspired by Mapbox Streets Japan [Mapbox Streets Japan](https://www.mapbox.com/gallery/#mapbox-streets%20japan).

The interactive elements enabled me to involve the viewer in the tour and create a personal connection, much like I would do in person. The viewer is taken through a series of pop ups that describe each location. The map subtly centers on each marker as the viewer 'walks.' The path acts to mimic myself and the viewer walking through the neighbourhood to each site. 
Ultimately, the map shows how place and community are created through multiple competing stories, identities and histories. It was an experimentative process to center my voice, relationship and storytelling of Chinatown through cartography. I felt as if I threw out a lot of what I've been taught to be design rules for cartography, particularly in map styling.
