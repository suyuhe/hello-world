In many ways, this map is a love letter to Chinatown. with the goal of translating my knowledge and sense of place in a map format. I centre much of my place-based identity in Chinatowns given my family's immigration history of settling in Chinatown, Calgary. Its a place where I still do a lot of errands and I often take friends on a personal tour of the area while checking out local shops. This map is designed to translate this tour and my knowledge of Chinatown. 

Particularly, the tour and map highlight the layers of contested spaces, through displacement, placemaking and competing boundaries. The official Vancouver city boundaries are imposed as layers you can toggle. Notably, Chinatown is not an official place. Rather, Chinatown sits in the middle of the boundaries of downtown and strathcona neighbourhoods, highlighting competing spaces and boundaries.

Throughout the tour, I highlight other layers of competing boundaries by exploring historical Japantown and Hogan's Alley, both unofficial ethnic enclaves that existed in the 1900s and were torn down due to systemic racism and classism. 

Given that this map is a translation of my personal knowledge, sense of place, and connection to Chinatown I wanted the map to convey a sense of fun, happiness and dream-like nostalgia (as connected to my personal family history). Therefore, I chose more unconventional colours including the muted pastel purple to represent landcover and the bright pink to convey such qualities. I matched the other colours to create a pastel palette including muted greens and blues for parks and water cover. I got rid of most of the default labels for places such as restaurants, shops and schools to declutter the map and enable the viewer to focus on the tour spots highlighted. 

This map is a representation and experimentation in subjectivity and contestion of histories. Like how place is created through personal histories, stories and identities
