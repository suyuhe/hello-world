I designed this map for to organizations and people involved supporting the Rohingya refugee crisis. Compared to other refugee sites, there is a lot more up-to-date data on the Rohingya Crisis. However, maps produced using these datasets are normally static paper maps/infographics [example](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/infographic/bangladesh-cox%E2%80%99s-bazar-refugee-population-31-january-2021). Contrastingly, population data is released monthly, requiring static maps to be produced monthly as well. This map is designed as an interactive alternative to static data maps to ensure ease of data updates and accessibility. Furthermore, the map is designed to be aesthetically compelling and simplistic to enable public usership with the goal of increasing publically accessibility and understanding of the Rohingya refugee crisis. 

The default zoom level displays the whole network of camps, with the interactive zoom function inviting viewers to zoom in on camp areas of interest. This ensures that the map is usable on multiple zoom levels, with graduated symbols adjusting based on zoom. The "network view" of the refugee camps provide users with an initial understanding that refugee camps are not singular, disconnected, sites; rather they are part of a larger network, the refugee camp system. This is accentuated through the inclusion of roadways, rendered white and major roadways labeled, emphasizing that camp sites are connected. The inclusion of the legend and title ensures that users are situated in the context immediately. This is especially important as the site is not displayed at a country level and viewers unfamiliar with the area may not immediately realize it is Bangladesh without a title. 

By presenting the basemap as light muted green, I wanted to remind viewers that the refugee camps are located in a highly forested area. Other base map colours were subtly muted to ensure colour consistency and visual harmony, as discussed in "The Guide to Map Design." Population symbol colours were chosen to pop out at the viewer compared to other elements with red/orange/yellow. These colours were picked from colour brewer to ensure colour-blindness accessibility. Camp divisions contrast the population symbols with blue, attempting to use complementary colors (blue-orange). Lastly, in terms of improving on the map, I'm a bit disappointed I was unable to get some form of pop up function to work to show the population numbers on mouse over.
